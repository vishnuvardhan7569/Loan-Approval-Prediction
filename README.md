Loan Approval Prediction

Project Overview:
This project predicts whether a loan application will be approved or rejected using machine learning. It demonstrates an end-to-end workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

Dataset Features:
- ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, LoanAmount, Loan_Amount_Term
- Credit_History, Gender, Married, Education, Self_Employed, Property_Area
- Loan_Status (target variable)

Approach:
1. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numeric features.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize feature distributions, correlations, and categorical relationships.
3. Modeling: Train and compare multiple classifiers: Random Forest, KNN, SVC, Logistic Regression.
4. Evaluation: Use Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrices to measure performance.

Key Results:
- RandomForestClassifier performed best overall on the test set.
- Confusion matrices show fewer misclassifications for Random Forest.
- Visualizations and metrics help understand model strengths and weaknesses.

How to Run:
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loan-approval-prediction.git
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts:
   jupyter notebook

Next Steps:
- Hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance
- Feature engineering to capture important interactions
- Handle class imbalance for better predictions
- Deploy model as a web or API application

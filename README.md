💰 Loan Approval Prediction 
==========================================================

📄 Project Overview
------------------
Predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected
using machine learning. This project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow
from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

📊 Dataset Features
------------------
💵 ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, LoanAmount, Loan_Amount_Term
✅ Credit_History, Gender, Married, Education, Self_Employed, Property_Area
🎯 Loan_Status (target variable)

⚙️ Approach
-----------
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numeric features 
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize distributions, correlations, and categorical relationships 
3️⃣ Modeling: Train and compare classifiers:
   - 🌲 Random Forest
   - 🔢 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - 🧩 Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
   - 📈 Logistic Regression
4️⃣ Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrices

🏆 Key Results
-------------
- 🌟 RandomForestClassifier performed best overall on the test set
- 📉 Confusion matrices show fewer misclassifications for Random Forest
- 📊 Metrics and visualizations highlight model strengths and weaknesses

🚀 How to Run
------------
1️⃣ Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loan-approval-prediction.git
2️⃣ Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3️⃣ Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts:
   jupyter notebook

🔧 Next Steps
------------
- ⚡ Hyperparameter tuning for improved performance
- ✨ Feature engineering to capture important interactions
- 🔄 Handle class imbalance for better predictions
- 🌐 Deploy model as a web or API application
